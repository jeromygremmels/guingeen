                            <p>Набор инструкций SSE4a был введен компанией AMD в процессоры на архитектуре Barcelona. Это расширение не доступно в процессорах Intel. sse4a (sse128) - набор из 4 инструкций потокового simd-расширения, используемый в процессорах. SSE4 subsets. Intel SSE4 consists of 54 instructions. A subset consisting of 47 instructions, referred to as SSE4.1 in some Intel documentation, is available in Penryn. Looking at the CPU specs, it supports this instruction set. I can't afford a whole new motherboard any time soon so I got the best Phenom II processor I could, and it's been fine with the majority of games, being roughly equivalent to what's in the Xbone and PS4. This is the only game that doesn't run - some other games did have issues with SSE on the Phenom II but it was patched out. Respawn clearly have no issue whatsoever letting a significant portion of the player В принципе моя суть вопроса в этом заключается. Прошу сразу если можно то объяснить сначала на более простым языком, а потом что-то типо из разряда википедии. Hello Games have been mentioning SSE4 in their post instead of SSE4.1 which is the one that the community has been talking about, which one is it? I read that the SSE4a is a partial implementation of SSE4.1, does it mean that if the game requires SSE4.1 i wont be able to play it? Its a Phenom II x4 840 by the way. Im getting a new CPU anyway but if this is true i wont be able to play for 2 weeks. SSE4a is a set of 4 SIMD instructions introduced in AMD K10 microarchitecture: EXTRQ - extracts a set of bits from a register. INSERTQ - inserts a set of bits located in source register into a destination register. So it seems one of the major issues people are having with running this game comes from the fact that they are running on AMD CPU's, that do not support the SSE 4.1 instruction set, as they instead opted for their proprietary SSE 4a. This is nasty, as a great number of these CPU's are far more powerful than the Minimum Required i3 processor and it is just this lousy instruction set letting a huge swathe of people weep gently over their keyboards as they see the "Hello Games" splash screen. 
SSE4 ( Streaming SIMD Extensions 4 ) is a SIMD CPU instruction set used in the Intel Core microarchitecture and AMD K10 (K8L)  It was announced on 27 September 2006 at the Fall 2006 Intel Developer Forum , with vague details in a white paper ; more precise details of 47 instructions became.  is there a new version for this crack to be able to play this on a amd anthlon x2 which only supports SSE4a. i havent tried downloading the game yet but i see a lot of people having issues running this game through a sse4a only supported. Hello.We are using Intel IPP library version 5.3. And facing a problems on AMD processors with SSE4a instruction set.Wich version of IPP library supports this instruction set? How to get this version (what is licensing policy). Hi all, I recently have a new Thinkpad A285. The form and performance of the machine is great, but I'm noticing that the power draw is higher-than-should-be. When I run `powertop`, I get an average power draw of 11 Watts while idle (i.e., screen brightness at 5%, not doing anything besides). In this review (https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-A285-Ryzen-5-Pro-Vega-8-FHD-Laptop-Review.391526.0.html) the average power draw is said to be 8.2 Watts, between 5.8 and 9.96. I can't Процессоры семейства работающего по этой технологии потребляют где-то 10 А, и имеют 12 фаз, имеют 755 ножек. Both my original months-old version and the latest stable version from their website cause a bluescreen on my Windows VM. I know this isn't much help but it did run some months ago. The VM has been so stable I haven't cared to monitor it until now.

Windows doesn't seem to move beyond 0% collecting data so I have to force

Losing connection, lagging in the most awful moments. I have launch options on, I'm using fps fixes and from what I have heard, my computer should be able to run medium at least. Any help would be appreciated. I'm about to pull my hair out. My internet is like 400Mbps. So I dont think that is the issue. I've reinstalled ark, mods, now trying maps. ---- Computer.

Like many people I've seen, I'm running a Core 2 Quad q9400 while my GPU and Ram are more than good enough, this socket doesn't support SSE4a, and as such gives a POPCNT error.

The most promising so far are the ones used to deal with this same probably for the game Quantum Break. This is where I'm starting github.com/ogurets/.
